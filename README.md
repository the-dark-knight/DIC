Digitial Image Correlation


*INTRODUCTION*

The code is primarily written by my friends though I edited it a bit and contributed to the GUI. 
The aim of the code is to generate the strain and displacement data for a pair of images - one deformed and one undeformed. Just run the main_code file and proceed as the GUI prompts. All the functions have been commented for the ease of understanding.

Oh yes, and you have all the rights to edit and improve the code. A little credit to Ankit Shrivastava, Anurag Bhatt, Ahsen Parvez and Gaurav Gupta will be great though.
